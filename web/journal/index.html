        My first day of trip! i can't believe i finally get everything packed and ready to
        go.Because I'm on a Segway ,I wasn't able to bring a whole a lot with me ;cell phone ,iPod,digigtal
        camera,and a protein bar.Just the essentials.As Lao Tuz would have said,"A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one step Segway".
